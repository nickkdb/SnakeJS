## Description
> This site recreates the classic game Snake, where you chase a target and each time you hit it, the body of the "snake" grows longer. This project was built using vanilla javascript, node, CSS, and HTML. MongoDB was integrated to control submission and viewing highscores via the leaderboards. 

## Usage
> To use this project, navigate to the link provided. Select your difficulty by increasing or decreasing the speed slider, and hit start. This will display the sprites on the screen. Clicking an arrow key will start the game, which is how you move the snake. Not currently supported on mobile.
